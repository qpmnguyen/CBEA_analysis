This folder held individual analyses with their own targets workflow and defined by the localized functions. While this allows for workflows to be ran in chunks per analysis, it creates an issue where files are copied from their original folders (in `R`) and functions are not localized or well organized. As such, changing and maintaining these functions become very difficult. 

For any additional analyses required by revisions, the new project based `targets` pipeline will be used instead. Check out [the documentation](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/projects.html#the-config-package) here. This functionality was not available when this analysis was first conceived. This folder will be kept the same for archival and reproducibility purposes, as well as for other analyses that does not require repeating. The pipelines themselves should still run normally according to old instructions.
